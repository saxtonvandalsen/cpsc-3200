    // - The capacity must be greater than 0, setting a limit on the number of messages stored in memory and on file.
    // - The WRITE_THRESHOLD determines the frequency of file writes to balance efficiency with data durability.
    // - The initialState accurately reflects the messages synced from the file, allowing reset operations to restore this state.
    // - DurableStream extends reading to both in-memory messages and any that is maintained in the backing file.
    // - Resetting will restore both in-memory and file messages to the original state of when the object was first created.

    //   own file, maintaining data integrity, and avoiding resource contention.
