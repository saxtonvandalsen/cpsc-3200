# CPSC 3200 Object-Oriented Development
This repository contains my projects and assignments for CPSC 3200: Object-Oriented Development. In this course, I developed a deep understanding of object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Through practical coding exercises, I designed and implemented class hierarchies, interfaces, and design patterns that emphasize code reusability and maintainability. The projects showcase my ability to apply advanced OOP principles to create robust and scalable software solutions while adhering to high standards of code quality. This experience has also honed my skills in critical analysis, problem-solving, and the use of modern development tools in professional environments including Linux, Visual Studio Code, JetBrains Rider, and JetBrains CLion.

In addition to developing object-oriented solutions, this course emphasized the importance of thorough testing and debugging practices. I gained hands-on experience writing unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components and driver functions to test entire systems in isolation. These practices reinforced my understanding of how to identify and resolve edge cases, ensure code correctness, and maintain software reliability. The structured approach to testing and debugging not only improved the quality of my code but also enhanced my ability to systematically diagnose and address issues in complex projects.
